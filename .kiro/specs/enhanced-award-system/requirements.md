# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Award System expands Chemezy's discovery mechanics by implementing a comprehensive achievement and recognition system. This system rewards players for various contributions including chemical discoveries, database corrections through debug endpoints, and community participation. The system includes both predefined awards and a dynamic meta-award system that allows administrators to create new awards programmatically.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1


**User Story:** As a player, I want to receive awards for discovering new chemical reactions, so that my contributions to the scientific database are recognized and I feel motivated to continue experimenting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player triggers a world-first reaction THEN the system SHALL create a discovery award record linked to that player and reaction
2. WHEN a player views their profile THEN the system SHALL display all discovery awards they have earned
3. WHEN a discovery award is created THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as timestamp, reaction details, and award tier
4. IF a reaction has already been discovered THEN the system SHALL NOT create duplicate discovery awards

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to earn awards for helping fix database issues through debug endpoints, so that my contributions to data quality are acknowledged and incentivized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player successfully submits a valid correction through debug endpoints THEN the system SHALL create a database contribution award
2. WHEN a correction is verified as accurate THEN the system SHALL upgrade the award tier if applicable
3. WHEN multiple corrections are made by the same player THEN the system SHALL track cumulative contribution metrics
4. IF a correction is later found to be invalid THEN the system SHALL have the ability to revoke or downgrade the award

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create new award types dynamically through a meta-award system, so that I can respond to community needs and create special recognition programs without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a new award template THEN the system SHALL store the template with configurable criteria and metadata
2. WHEN award criteria are met THEN the system SHALL automatically grant awards based on the template configuration
3. WHEN an admin modifies an award template THEN the system SHALL apply changes to future awards without affecting existing ones
4. IF an award template has complex criteria THEN the system SHALL support conditional logic and multiple trigger conditions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to view a comprehensive awards dashboard, so that I can track my achievements and see what awards are available to earn.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player accesses their awards dashboard THEN the system SHALL display earned awards with details and timestamps
2. WHEN viewing available awards THEN the system SHALL show progress toward earning incomplete awards
3. WHEN awards have tiers or levels THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate current tier and requirements for advancement
4. IF awards have special visual elements THEN the system SHALL display appropriate badges, icons, or visual indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see leaderboards and community recognition, so that I can compare my achievements with other players and feel part of a competitive community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing leaderboards THEN the system SHALL display rankings based on different award categories
2. WHEN a player achieves a significant milestone THEN the system SHALL provide options for community announcements
3. WHEN awards have rarity or special significance THEN the system SHALL highlight these achievements prominently
4. IF players opt-in to public profiles THEN the system SHALL allow others to view their award collections

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage and moderate the award system, so that I can ensure fair play and maintain the integrity of the recognition system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing award grants THEN the system SHALL provide admin tools to verify, modify, or revoke awards
2. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL flag potential award farming or abuse
3. WHEN creating special events THEN the system SHALL support time-limited or conditional award campaigns
4. IF disputes arise THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs of all award-related actions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the award system to integrate seamlessly with existing reaction and debug systems, so that awards are granted automatically without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing reaction endpoints process requests THEN the system SHALL check for award eligibility without impacting performance
2. WHEN debug endpoints are used successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger appropriate award evaluations
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity between awards and related entities
4. IF the award system experiences issues THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully without breaking core functionality
